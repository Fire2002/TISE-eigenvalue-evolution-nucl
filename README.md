# TISE eigenvalue evolution problem (Nuclear Physics)

NCUS PY 506 problem to determine the 10 lowest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for $l \in 0,1,2$ such that $A_{so}$ = 0 (where $A_{so}$ is the spin-orbit term of the Woods-Saxon nuclear potential).

Using those eigenvalues, we create a plot of how the eigenvalues evolve as a function of $A_{so}$.

The code document was unretrievable; however, screenshots of the code are provided in the paper.
